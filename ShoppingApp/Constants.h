#define watchDecsription1 @"The Oyster Perpetual Submariner is the quintessential divers’ watch, the benchmark in its genre. Introduced in 1953 during the pioneering era for scuba diving, it was the first watch to be water-resistant to 100 metres (330 feet). This iconic timepiece has since evolved with a series of patented Rolex technical innovations, guaranteeing its reliability and precision down to depths of 300 metres (1,000 feet). At home in the oceans, where it remains an indispensable instrument for every diver, the Submariner has also conquered terra firma as the watch of action with a rugged elegance of its own. The Submariner is available with and without the date function."

#define watchDecsription2 @"The Rolex Yacht-Master is a sport watch made by Rolex, first introduced in 1992 with the model 16628 in 18-carat yellow gold. In 1994, Rolex released a lady's model (69628) and a mid-size man's model (68628), which was the first time Rolex had ever issued a smaller professional size watch. In 1996, Rolex introduced two-tone (stainless steel and 18-carat yellow gold) to the lady's and mid-size line. In 1997, Rolex released the Yacht-Master in Rolesium, a term patented by Rolex in 1932 which gives the Yacht-Master a stainless steel and platinum construction; the bezel and dial are platinum, while the case, band, crown, etc. are stainless steel. This model is also known as the Platinum Yacht-Master. In 1999, Rolex discontinued the model two-tone 68623, replacing it with the two-tone model 168623 in 2000. The difference between the two models are in the upgraded movement in the 168623, and the heavier 18-carat gold links (the links in the 68623 are hollow)."

#define watchDecsription3 @"The Cosmograph Daytona, introduced in 1963, was designed to meet the demands of professional racing drivers. With its highly reliable chronograph and bezel with tachymetric scale, it allows drivers to perfectly measure average speeds up to 400 kilometres or miles per hour, as they choose. An icon eternally joined in name and function to the high-performance world of motor sport.The Oyster Perpetual Cosmograph Daytona is the consummate Rolex chronograph. Efficient, precise, legible, robust, reliable, waterproof and self‑winding, it is also comfortable, elegant, timeless and highly prestigious. Judging by the success and outstanding reputation worldwide of this peerless alchemy of form and function, it is considered in many respects to be the ultimate chronograph. Fifty years after its launch in 1963, this embodiment of perfection is the product of a long maturation process. Each inscription on the dial of a Rolex watch is a guarantee of performance; on this emblematic model, they were added one by one as the watch evolved. Solely “Cosmograph” at the outset, over the years “Oyster”, “Perpetual”, “Cosmograph”, “Daytona” and “Superlative Chronometer Officially Certified” were added, chronicling a legend in watchmaking."

#define watchDecsription4 @"The Rolex Oyster Perpetual Milgauss is a wristwatch model introduced by Rolex in 1956 with model number 6451. The Milgauss was designed as an antimagnetic watch specifically for those who worked in power plants, medical facilities and research labs (like those in Geneva) where electromagnetic fields can cause havoc with the timing of a watch. The current model Milgauss is equipped with a magnetic alloy (Parachrom-Blu) hairspring and movement encased by a magnetic shield (note: this is not a Faraday cage, which only shields electrostatic fields), most likely composed of a high magnetic permeability material (see Mu-metal or Permalloy). The name Milgauss is derived from the Latin mille, which means one-thousand, and gauss, the unit of a magnetic field. This model is so named because it can withstand a magnetic flux density of 1,000 gauss."

#define IPHONEDESCRIPTION @"iPhone 5s is purposefully imagined. Meticulously considered. Precision crafted. It’s not just a product of what’s technologically possible. But what’s technologically useful. It’s not just what’s next. But what should be next.iPhone 5 set a precedent, with an amazing amount of technology in a remarkably thin, light design. iPhone 5s builds on that achievement with Touch ID — a ﬁngerprint identity sensor. An A7 chip with 64-bit architecture. An even more impressive iSight camera. And ultra-fast wireless.iPhone 5s is the first 64‑bit smartphone in the world. And iOS 7 was designed with that in mind, built specifically for 64‑bit architecture. Which makes iOS 7 just as advanced as the iPhone it’s on.The iPhone 5s Case is precisely designed to fit iPhone perfectly. Made from premium leather, it looks elegant and feels luxurious. And inside, a soft, colour-matched microfibre lining helps protect your iPhone 5s."

#define HTCDESCRIPTION @"The HTC One (M8) (also known as the second generation HTC One or the all-new HTC One) is an Android smartphone manufactured and marketed by HTC. Following a number of leaks which occurred during the months prior, the second-generation One was officially unveiled in a press conference on March 25, 2014, and released the same day by Verizon Wireless at retail, and by other Canadian and United States carriers for online orders prior to its wider retail availability in mid-April. The new model retains a similar design to the first generation HTC One, but features a larger, rounded chassis incorporating a 5-inch 1080p display, a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor, a depth of field sensor which can be used to individually refocus and apply various effects to the foreground and background elements of photos taken with the device's camera, a higher resolution front camera, improvements to the device's front-facing stereo speakers, expandable storage, new gesture functionality, and a refreshed version of HTC's Sense software. The second generation One received mostly positive reviews, with particular praise devoted to the design improvements within its hardware and software, and its upgraded internals in comparison to the previous One. However, some reviewers criticized certain aspects of the new One, such as its large bezels, the lack of significant improvements to the main camera's image quality, and the inconsistent quality of the effects enabled by the depth sensor."

#define XPERIADESCRIPTION @"The Sony Xperia Z2 is a high-end Android smartphone manufactured by Sony. Under the codename Sirius, Xperia Z2 serves as the successor to the Sony Xperia Z1. Like its predecessor, the Xperia Z2 is water and dust proof with an IP rating of IP55 and IP58. The phone features a new display, a Snapdragon 801 processor and the ability to record 4K videos.

The phone comes with the same aluminium frame as its predecessor. It also features tempered Gorilla Glass 3 on the front and back with an aluminium power button placed on the right side of the device."
